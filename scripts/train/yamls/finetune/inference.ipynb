Around that time, the State was pressuring all areas in the state that were not already in a borough (county), to become boroughs so that they would take responsibility for governance and the public schools. The Aleutians East Borough was then created as the legal mid-level entity, covering False Pass and five other communities in the area.  The residents of the village of False Pass at the time had little enthusiasm for becoming a \\'city\\' and to pay taxes. But, under the leadership of Borge Larsen, the City\\'s first Mayor, the legal, political and administrative hurdles were overcome. The most important reasons for becoming a city were to support the public school in False Pass and to\\xa0begin to build the service infrastructure needed for a modern community. Under Borge\\'s leadership, the city built a new City Office and Rec Center, moved the post office to a new location in the community\\xa0and began to lay plans for a City Dock and Boat Harbor. Until this time, the village had depended upon the docks, post office, stores etc. at the salmon cannery and had little infrastructure of its own.  Borge was born in Denmark and came to live in False Pass in 1950. His first job was as salmon trap watchman, but in 1951 he became the \"winterman\" with his uncle Chris Larsen and he watched over the cannery in the off-season when it was closed. During the summers he was the Beach Boss at Peter Pan. He was also the Assistant Post Master when the post office was still in the Peter Pan office. He ran the post office during the wintertime for many years until he retired.\\nnan,nan\\nCity infrastructure  has now been completed for most of the services needed in a modern community. This includes an all weather airport, a city dock that accomodates the Alaska State Ferry and general cargo, a new Boat Harbor, a city-wide water system, fire department, electrical system, library, post office, clinic and public school. Maps showing the location of this infrastructure are on the City page of this website.  The City is governed by a City Council  consisting of seven members.\\xa0The City has a Mayor who also does the work of the administrator. The current Mayor of False Pass is Tom Hoblet.  The City tax rates are as follows:  Sales and Use Tax: 3%  Bed Tax (hotels): 6%  Raw Fish Tax: 2%  Current positions in the City administration, as well as much more information about the City, can be seen on the City\\'s website  here .,nan\\nnan,nan\\nA Bit of History......  The U.S. Mail arrived in False Pass  via seaplane after the mail boat service was stopped and until the construction of the airport was finished in about 1962. The seaplane was the Reeve Aleutian Grumman Goose and, depending on the weather, arrived about once a week.\\xa0On this day it appears that the cannery chartered the plane to take out some workers. Usually the mail plane is met by many local people and their dogs and the postmaster.  In this photo, we see the Postmaster, Bill Bright, holding the U.S. mail sack and the cannery superintendent, Don Rawlinson, in the blue jacket, watching the action. The Beach Boss, Borge Larsen, is seen in the red hat, walking down to the plane.  Usually, everyone pitched in and helped carry the mail to the post office which was located in the cannery office. The seaplane landed right next to the cannery, that can be seen on the right.  Click on picture to see a larger version.,nan\\nnan,nan\\nFalse Pass was a classic Alaskan cannery village  until the cannery burned in 1981.\\xa0The cannery provided all the basic infrastructure for the village, including docks, post office, clinic, radio communications, stores and the first school.,This is the village of False Pass in the 1930\\'s.  The\\xa0local residents lived mostly along the beach, some in cabins on company property in the mid-foreground, but the majority lived \"up the beach\" starting with the Kristensen residence on the lower left. Two residences had been built very early near the cannery, the Vanner house and the Gardner place.\\nnan,Click on picture for larger version\\nnan,nan\\nnan,The Mail Boat, Expansion:  The Expansion was built by Northwestern Shipbuilding, Bellingham, Washington in April 1944 for the US Army. She was \"Coastal Freighter #FS 244 540\". She was sold by the army and re-named the \"Dennis Winn\". The Dennis Winn was named after an official with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the vessel carried supplies to the Pribilofs and other USFWS locations before Alaska statehood. Later the vessel was re-named the \"Expansion\"and began work as a mail boat.  The Expansion served as a mail boat for the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands and stopped monthly at False Pass to bring the mail and passengers, sailing out of Seward. She also had on board a small store where one could buy fresh produce, ice cream and other perishables. The Expansion was later sold and re-named the \"Temehani\" and sank in Bora Bora in 1982.  1\\nnan,nan\\nnan,nan\\nnan,nan\\nnan,Steamer Starr, Mail and Passenger Service to False Pass:  The old timers often talked about the Steamer Starr that came to False Pass every month for many years.\\xa0She was built in 1913 by J.F. Duthie & Co. and spent many years of service in southwest Alaska.  A report by the governor of Alaska to the Secretary of the Interior in 1921 states: \"Effective with December last, contract was effected under the merchant marine act with the San Juan Fishing & Packing Co.. who now operate the steamer Starr from Seward via Seldovia and intermediate points to Unalaska, and to Nushagak and Dillingham during the season of navigation in Bering Sea. This boat operates on a regular schedule, leaving Seward about the 10th of each month in close connection with the steamers of the Alaska Steamship Co. The steamer Starr is equipped to handle a considerable number of passengers, has a wireless telegraph apparatus, etc., and is giving the Alaska Peninsula excellent service.\"  2\\nnan,nan\\nnan,Sea Freight Service to False Pass:  The Alaska Steamship Company out of Seattle provided freight service to much of Alaska, including False Pass, from 1895 to 1971. After World War II, the company\\xa0purchased a number of \"Liberty Ships\" from the U.S. Maritime Commission and used them as freighters. Traditionally, the freighter would arrive in False Pass in early spring with much needed supplies for the village and materials for starting up the cannery. Then, another freighter would arrive usually in June to bring more supplies\\xa0and perhaps more tin for the cannery and take out whatever canned fish was ready. Then, another freighter would arrive after the salmon pack was finished, probably in mid-September, to take out the salmon pack and bring in supplies for the winter.\\xa0The villagers would place their grubstake winter orders with the cannery bookkeeper to arrive on this last freighter in the fall. The P.E. Harris cannery store received all of its supplies on the freighter to tide the village over until spring. Depending on freight needs for the cannery and village, there were usually no freighters in wintertime.  The Oduna was\\tone of these liberty ships. She was built in 1945 by New England Shipbuilding Corporation, East Yard, South Portland, Maine as Liberty ship type EC-S-C1 for United States Maritime Commission. In 1951 she was sold to Tramp Cargo Carriers, NY renamed Liberty Bell. Then in 1956 she was sold to Polarus SS Co., NY renamed I.R. Lashins. Again in 1957 she was sold to Southport SS Corp., NY renamed Southport. In 1964 she was purchased by Alaska Steamship Co. and renamed Oduna and modified to carry containers. On the 26th of November 1965 she ran aground at Cape Pankof, Unimak Island, Alaska and was a total loss. Cape Pankof is located on the Ikatan Peninsula, about 25 miles south of False Pass. She weighed 7,216 tons.  3\\nnan,nan\\n| Return to Menu |,| Return to Menu |\\nReferences:  1)  http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergency/wwtwo/northwestern.htm  2) Report of the Governor of Alaska to the Secretary of the Interior By Alaska.

North Carolina Department of Revenue Post Office Box 25000 Raleigh, North Carolina 27640-0001. \\nG.S. 105-164.13B provides that food is exempt from the State sales and use tax\\nunless the specific food item is included in one of the five categories listed in the\\nfollowing paragraph:\\n“Food” is defined broadly as “Substances that are sold for ingestion\\nor chewing by humans and are consumed for their taste or nutritional\\nvalue.  The substances may be in liquid, concentrated, solid, frozen,\\ndried,  or  dehydrated  form.    The  term  does  not  include  an  alcoholic\\nbeverage,  as  defined  in  G.S.  105-113.68,  or  a  tobacco  product,  as\\ndefined in G.S. 105-113.4.”\\n. Food that is exempt from the State sales and use tax is subject to the 2% county tax. The additional ½% Mecklenburg County tax and the additional 1% Dare County tax (the additional 1% Dare County tax is repealed effective July 1, 2006) do not apply to sales of food that is exempt from the State tax. The law provides that food included in the following categories is not exempt from the State tax but is subject to the applicable State and local sales and use tax: dietary supplements, food sold through a vending machine (however, receipts of items sold through vending machines are subject to tax at 50% of the sales price), prepared food, soft drinks, and candy. There have been misunderstandings by taxpayers regarding the taxation of some items that, although they meet the definition of food, may be included in one of the five excluded categories listed in the preceding paragraph. The primary area of concern pertains to “prepared food.” A food item is considered to be a “prepared food” and subject to the State and local rates of tax if one of the following conditions exists:  1) it is sold in a heated state or it is heated by the retailer, 2) it consists of two or more foods mixed or combined by the retailer for sale as a single item (not including foods containing raw eggs, fish, meat, or poultry that must be cooked by the consumer to prevent food borne illnesses, or 3) it is sold with eating utensils such as plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, and straws that are provided by the retailer. 1) Breads, cakes, and similar bakery items are subject to the 2% local tax unless the items are considered to be prepared f oods, in which case they are subject to the general State and applicable local rates of tax. \\nG.S. 105-164.13B provides that food is exempt from the State sales and use tax\\nunless the specific food item is included in one of the five categories listed in the\\nfollowing paragraph:\\n“Food” is defined broadly as “Substances that are sold for ingestion\\nor chewing by humans and are consumed for their taste or nutritional\\nvalue.

The classes of exempt lessees are:  Lessees that are governmental bodies  Charitable, Educational, and Religious Organizations  Insurance Companies  There are twelve types of exempt leases. They include:  Property leased outside the city that is primarily used outside the city (50%)  Property that is leased from a party subject to certain occupation taxes  Leases of \"rolling stock\" in interstate commerce by an interstate carrier for hire  Leases of property where the rental price is paid by inserting one or more coins or bills of U.S. currency into an attached mechanism  Leases of medical equipment or appliances for the purpose of correcting or treating parts of his or her own body  The lease of a ground transportation vehicle if the lessor is subject to the ground transportation tax. This exemption is not available to a transportation network provider, transportation network driver, or transportation network vehicle owner.  Leases of property where the lessor and lessee are members of the same related group. \"Related\" means companies under a parent corporation/person that owns 100% of the voting stock of subsidiaries either directly or indirectly.  Leases by a membership organization to a member of such membership organization. This includes the trading companies on the stock exchange. This is similar to related parties in that the member must be directly or indirectly owned by a member of the Membership Organization.  The nonpossessory lease of a computer used in execution, clearing, processing, matching or recording of a trade on a board of trade designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or on a securities exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other trade of any security or any comparable security with respect to commodities, whether or not the parties to the lease also are parties to the trade.  The nonpossessory lease of a computer used to deposit, withdraw, transfer, or lend money or securities (i.e., ATM machines, banking transactions).  The nonpossessory computer lease in which the customer’s use or control of the computer is de minimis and the related charge is predominantly for information transferred (e.g., the nonpossessory lease of a computer to receive current price quotations)  Lease of motion picture film by theaters is exempt. (Motion picture films are subject to the Amusement Tax.)

This 1993 ruling pre-dated the enactment of Code Section 3-32-050(A)(7), which added an exemption for “[t]he lease, rental or use of personal property if the lessor and lessee are members of the same related group.” The ordinance superseded the ruling, which therefore is no longer in effect. It is retained on this web site for historical purposes only.  Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling 11  In  Hertz Corp. v.

Contractors who irrevocably entered into a pre-existing lump sum or unit price construction contract before July 1, 2019 (the date on which the local legislation was adopted), may request a credit or refund of the additional 1% local sales and use tax paid on or after August 1, 2019. This credit or refund applies only to purchases of tangible personal property used solely in the performance of the contract. (7/19). Westchester County Increases Sales and Use Tax Rate. Beginning August 1, 2019, Westch ester County is increasing its local sales and use tax rate from 3% to 4%. This change applies to all taxable sales and uses in Westchester County outside the cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains, and Yonkers. Sales tax rate publications have been updated to reflect this change; see Sales tax rates by local taxing jurisdiction. Since the rates affected by this change are those within the county outside the cities listed above, only the following county and school district (S. D.) rates increase:. \\nForm or Schedule,,Old rate,New rate\\nMain form,,7(cid:490)%,(cid:27)(cid:490)%\\nSchedule B,Westchester County (outside the cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains, and Yonkers),3%,4%\\n,Mount Vernon S.

       " 'The.gov means it’s official. Purchase and Use Tax (32 V.S.A.). Purchase:. Purchase and Use Tax is due at the time of registration and/or title at a percentage of the purchase price or the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) clean trade-in value, whichever is greater, minus the value of the trade-in vehicle or any other allowable credit. If the vehicle is currently registered/titled to you or your spouse out-of-state, tax is based on NADA clean\\xa0trade-in book value and is due unless exempt. If you believe that the vehicle’s value is less than the NADA value, you may submit a Vermont Dealer Appraisal Form. If you are claiming the tax credit for a vehicle registered to you or your spouse or party to a civil union out-of-state, please send a copy of the Registration Certificate in your name or your spouse’s or party to a civil union name and complete section 7 of the application. You may be required to submit legal documentation that you and your spouse or party to a civil union were married or became a party to the civil union at the time the tax was paid out-of-state. Credit will be given for the purchase and use or sales tax paid on this vehicle to another jurisdiction. No additional tax will be due if the tax paid on an out-of-state registered vehicle was equal to or more than the Vermont tax rate. The tax will be calculated by the dealer/leasing company. A lease agreement or Vermont Dealer worksheet must be submitted with documents. If the individual purchases this vehicle at the end of the lease, they will pay tax on the \"residual/lease end value\" of the vehicle. The registration application is received from a Vermont Dealer or a Vermont Dealer acting on behalf of the Lessor. A \"Purchase and Use Tax Computation - Leased Vehicle\" Form (form #VD-147) may be submitted in lieu of a copy of the lease agreement and dealer worksheet.

No, not from Vermont. Several states, including Florida, will collect taxes equal to the rate of your home state. In this example, the Vermont tax is 6%, so they will charge you 6% tax. That tax money is not transferred to Vermont. The only way to get any portion of it refunded to you is to contact the state that collected the tax. The documentation fee, which represents a charge for the preparation and handling of sale documents regardless of whether or not the vehicle is financed, should be included in the overall purchase price of the vehicle and is therefore subject to the Purchase and Use Tax.

No other changes were made to the ordinance.\\nMaximum Tax (Refund Cap)\\nThe maximum tax is the amount of tax that may apply to a single transaction. If the purchaser pays more than the\\nmaximum tax amount on a purchase, the purchaser may apply to the Tax Commissioner for a refund of any tax paid\\nin excess of the maximum tax. Retailers may voluntarily collect up to the maximum tax amount as a convenience to\\ntheir customers, so the purchasers do not need to apply for a refund. Retailers are not required to calculate\\nmaximum tax and may continue to collect tax without regard to the maximum tax. Retailers should be consistent in\\nthe method they choose to calculate local taxes.\\nMore information on state and local taxes, including the Local Taxes by Location Guideline, is available on our\\nwebsite at www.nd.gov/tax.
