For this reason, the previous 0.5% non-home rule municipal retailers’ occupation tax has been repealed and a 1.5% home rule municipal retailers’ occupation tax has been imposed. This brings the total rate to 9% (8% - 0.5% + 1.5% = 9%)."

nan,False Pass was incorporated  under the laws of Alaska as a 'second class' city in 1990. Around that time, the State was pressuring all areas in the state that were not already in a borough (county), to become boroughs so that they would take responsibility for governance and the public schools. The Aleutians East Borough was then created as the legal mid-level entity, covering False Pass and five other communities in the area.  The residents of the village of False Pass at the time had little enthusiasm for becoming a 'city' and to pay taxes. But, under the leadership of Borge Larsen, the City's first Mayor, the legal, political and administrative hurdles were overcome. The most important reasons for becoming a city were to support the public school in False Pass and to begin to build the service infrastructure needed for a modern community. Under Borge's leadership, the city built a new City Office and Rec Center, moved the post office to a new location in the community and began to lay plans for a City Dock and Boat Harbor. Until this time, the village had depended upon the docks, post office, stores etc. at the salmon cannery and had little infrastructure of its own.  Borge was born in Denmark and came to live in False Pass in 1950. His first job was as salmon trap watchman, but in 1951 he became the ""winterman"" with his uncle Chris Larsen and he watched over the cannery in the off-season when it was closed. During the summers he was the Beach Boss at Peter Pan. He was also the Assistant Post Master when the post office was still in the Peter Pan office. He ran the post office during the wintertime for many years until he retired.

City infrastructure  has now been completed for most of the services needed in a modern community. This includes an all weather airport, a city dock that accomodates the Alaska State Ferry and general cargo, a new Boat Harbor, a city-wide water system, fire department, electrical system, library, post office, clinic and public school. Maps showing the location of this infrastructure are on the City page of this website.  The City is governed by a City Council  consisting of seven members. The City has a Mayor who also does the work of the administrator. The current Mayor of False Pass is Tom Hoblet.  The City tax rates are as follows:  Sales and Use Tax: 3%  Bed Tax (hotels): 6%  Raw Fish Tax: 2%  Current positions in the City administration, as well as much more information about the City, can be seen on the City's website  here  .,nan

A Bit of History......  The U.S. Mail arrived in False Pass  via seaplane after the mail boat service was stopped and until the construction of the airport was finished in about 1962. The seaplane was the Reeve Aleutian Grumman Goose and, depending on the weather, arrived about once a week. On this day it appears that the cannery chartered the plane to take out some workers. Usually the mail plane is met by many local people and their dogs and the postmaster.  In this photo, we see the Postmaster, Bill Bright, holding the U.S. mail sack and the cannery superintendent, Don Rawlinson, in the blue jacket, watching the action. The Beach Boss, Borge Larsen, is seen in the red hat, walking down to the plane.  Usually, everyone pitched in and helped carry the mail to the post office which was located in the cannery office. The seaplane landed right next to the cannery, that can be seen on the right.  Click on picture to see a larger version.,nan

False Pass was a classic Alaskan cannery village  until the cannery burned in 1981. The cannery provided all the basic infrastructure for the village, including docks, post office, clinic, radio communications, stores and the first school.,This is the village of False Pass in the 1930's.  The local residents lived mostly along the beach, some in cabins on company property in the mid-foreground, but the majority lived ""up the beach"" starting with the Kristensen residence on the lower left. Two residences had been built very early near the cannery, the Vanner house and the Gardner place.

nan,The Mail Boat, Expansion:  The Expansion was built by Northwestern Shipbuilding, Bellingham, Washington in April 1944 for the US Army. She was ""Coastal Freighter #FS 244 540"". She was sold by the army and re-named the ""Dennis Winn"". The Dennis Winn was named after an official with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the vessel carried supplies to the Pribilofs and other USFWS locations before Alaska statehood. Later the vessel was re-named the ""Expansion""and began work as a mail boat.  The Expansion served as a mail boat for the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands and stopped monthly at False Pass to bring the mail and passengers, sailing out of Seward. She also had on board a small store where one could buy fresh produce, ice cream and other perishables. The Expansion was later sold and re-named the ""Temehani"" and sank in Bora Bora in 1982.  1

nan,Steamer Starr, Mail and Passenger Service to False Pass:  The old timers often talked about the Steamer Starr that came to False Pass every month for many years. She was built in 1913 by J.F. Duthie & Co. and spent many years of service in southwest Alaska.  A report by the governor of Alaska to the Secretary of the Interior in 1921 states: ""Effective with December last, contract was effected under the merchant marine act with the San Juan Fishing & Packing Co.. who now operate the steamer Starr from Seward via Seldovia and intermediate points to Unalaska, and to Nushagak and Dillingham during the season of navigation in Bering Sea. This boat operates on a regular schedule, leaving Seward about the 10th of each month in close connection with the steamers of the Alaska Steamship Co. The steamer Starr is equipped to handle a considerable number of passengers, has a wireless telegraph apparatus, etc., and is giving the Alaska Peninsula excellent service.""  2

nan,Sea Freight Service to False Pass:  The Alaska Steamship Company out of Seattle provided freight service to much of Alaska, including False Pass, from 1895 to 1971. After World War II, the company purchased a number of ""Liberty Ships"" from the U.S. Maritime Commission and used them as freighters. Traditionally, the freighter would arrive in False Pass in early spring with much needed supplies for the village and materials for starting up the cannery. Then, another freighter would arrive usually in June to bring more supplies and perhaps more tin for the cannery and take out whatever canned fish was ready. Then, another freighter would arrive after the salmon pack was finished, probably in mid-September, to take out the salmon pack and bring in supplies for the winter. The villagers would place their grubstake winter orders with the cannery bookkeeper to arrive on this last freighter in the fall. The P.E. Harris cannery store received all of its supplies on the freighter to tide the village over until spring. Depending on freight needs for the cannery and village, there were usually no freighters in wintertime.  The Oduna was	one of these liberty ships. She was built in 1945 by New England Shipbuilding Corporation, East Yard, South Portland, Maine as Liberty ship type EC-S-C1 for United States Maritime Commission. In 1951 she was sold to Tramp Cargo Carriers, NY renamed Liberty Bell. Then in 1956 she was sold to Polarus SS Co., NY renamed I.R. Lashins. Again in 1957 she was sold to Southport SS Corp., NY renamed Southport. In 1964 she was purchased by Alaska Steamship Co. and renamed Oduna and modified to carry containers. On the 26th of November 1965 she ran aground at Cape Pankof, Unimak Island, Alaska and was a total loss. Cape Pankof is located on the Ikatan Peninsula, about 25 miles south of False Pass. She weighed 7,216 tons.  3

G.S. 105-164.13B provides that food is exempt from the State sales and use tax
unless the specific food item is included in one of the five categories listed in the
following paragraph:
“Food” is defined broadly as “Substances that are sold for ingestion
or chewing by humans and are consumed for their taste or nutritional
value.  The substances may be in liquid, concentrated, solid, frozen,
dried,  or  dehydrated  form.    The  term  does  not  include  an  alcoholic
beverage,  as  defined  in  G.S.  105-113.68,  or  a  tobacco  product,  as
defined in G.S. 105-113.4.”
. Food that is exempt from the State sales and use tax is subject to the 2% county tax. The additional ½% Mecklenburg County tax and the additional 1% Dare County tax (the additional 1% Dare County tax is repealed effective July 1, 2006) do not apply to sales of food that is exempt from the State tax. The law provides that food included in the following categories is not exempt from the State tax but is subject to the applicable State and local sales and use tax: dietary supplements, food sold through a vending machine (however, receipts of items sold through vending machines are subject to tax at 50% of the sales price), prepared food, soft drinks, and candy. There have been misunderstandings by taxpayers regarding the taxation of some items that, although they meet the definition of food, may be included in one of the five excluded categories listed in the preceding paragraph. The primary area of concern pertains to “prepared food.” A food item is considered to be a “prepared food” and subject to the State and local rates of tax if one of the following conditions exists:  1) it is sold in a heated state or it is heated by the retailer, 2) it consists of two or more foods mixed or combined by the retailer for sale as a single item (not including foods containing raw eggs, fish, meat, or poultry that must be cooked by the consumer to prevent food borne illnesses, or 3) it is sold with eating utensils such as plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, and straws that are provided by the retailer. 1) Breads, cakes, and similar bakery items are subject to the 2% local tax unless the items are considered to be prepared f oods, in which case they are subject to the general State and applicable local rates of tax. 
G.S. 105-164.13B provides that food is exempt from the State sales and use tax
unless the specific food item is included in one of the five categories listed in the

Municipal Code Reference:,3-32
CAPS Code Reference:,1002920051802
Tax Return Form Code:,Form 7550
Procedure:,The Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax applies to businesses or individuals that either are a lessor or lessee of personal property used in Chicago.
Tax Base:,As of 1/1/2021:  9% of receipts or charges for all leases, including the non-possessory lease of a computer to input, modify, or retrieve data supplied by the customer  As of 1/1/2020:  7.25% of charges for the non-possessory lease of a computer to input, modify, or retrieve data supplied by the customer  9% of receipts or charges for other leases  As of 1/1/2016:  5.25% of charges for the non-possessory lease of a computer to input, modify, or retrieve data supplied by the customer  9% of receipts or charges for other leases  As of 1/1/2015:  9% of receipts or charges  Prior to 1/1/2015:  8% of receipts or charges
Exemptions, Deductions and Credits:,The ordinance differentiates between exempt lessees and exempt leases, rentals and uses. The classes of exempt lessees are:  Lessees that are governmental bodies  Charitable, Educational, and Religious Organizations  Insurance Companies  There are twelve types of exempt leases. They include:  Property leased outside the city that is primarily used outside the city (50%)  Property that is leased from a party subject to certain occupation taxes  Leases of ""rolling stock"" in interstate commerce by an interstate carrier for hire  Leases of property where the rental price is paid by inserting one or more coins or bills of U.S. currency into an attached mechanism  Leases of medical equipment or appliances for the purpose of correcting or treating parts of his or her own body  The lease of a ground transportation vehicle if the lessor is subject to the ground transportation tax. This exemption is not available to a transportation network provider, transportation network driver, or transportation network vehicle owner.  Leases of property where the lessor and lessee are members of the same related group. ""Related"" means companies under a parent corporation/person that owns 100% of the voting stock of subsidiaries either directly or indirectly.  Leases by a membership organization to a member of such membership organization. This includes the trading companies on the stock exchange. This is similar to related parties in that the member must be directly or indirectly owned by a member of the Membership Organization.  The nonpossessory lease of a computer used in execution, clearing, processing, matching or recording of a trade on a board of trade designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or on a securities exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other trade of any security or any comparable security with respect to commodities, whether or not the parties to the lease also are parties to the trade.  The nonpossessory lease of a computer used to deposit, withdraw, transfer, or lend money or securities (i.e., ATM machines, banking transactions).  The nonpossessory computer lease in which the customer’s use or control of the computer is de minimis and the related charge is predominantly for information transferred (e.g., the nonpossessory lease of a computer to receive current price quotations)  Lease of motion picture film by theaters is exempt. (Motion picture films are subject to the Amusement Tax.)  Affidavit for Apportionment of Use of Nonpossessory Computer Leases  Re-Lease and Registration Certificates  Transaction Tax Exemption Application for Small New Businesses

This 1993 ruling pre-dated the enactment of Code Section 3-32-050(A)(7), which added an exemption for “[t]he lease, rental or use of personal property if the lessor and lessee are members of the same related group.” The ordinance superseded the ruling, which therefore is no longer in effect. It is retained on this web site for historical purposes only.  Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling 11  In  Hertz Corp. v. City of Chicago  , 2017 IL 119945, the Illinois Supreme Court held Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Ruling #11 to be invalid. The ruling is therefore no longer in effect.

Purchase and Use Tax is due at the time of registration and/or title at a percentage of the purchase price or the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) clean trade-in value, whichever is greater, minus the value of the trade-in vehicle or any other allowable credit. If the vehicle is currently registered/titled to you or your spouse out-of-state, tax is based on NADA clean trade-in book value and is due unless exempt. If you believe that the vehicle’s value is less than the NADA value, you may submit a Vermont Dealer Appraisal Form. If you are claiming the tax credit for a vehicle registered to you or your spouse or party to a civil union out-of-state, please send a copy of the Registration Certificate in your name or your spouse’s or party to a civil union name and complete section 7 of the application. You may be required to submit legal documentation that you and your spouse or party to a civil union were married or became a party to the civil union at the time the tax was paid out-of-state. Credit will be given for the purchase and use or sales tax paid on this vehicle to another jurisdiction. No additional tax will be due if the tax paid on an out-of-state registered vehicle was equal to or more than the Vermont tax rate. The tax will be calculated by the dealer/leasing company. A lease agreement or Vermont Dealer worksheet must be submitted with documents. If the individual purchases this vehicle at the end of the lease, they will pay tax on the ""residual/lease end value"" of the vehicle. The registration application is received from a Vermont Dealer or a Vermont Dealer acting on behalf of the Lessor. A ""Purchase and Use Tax Computation - Leased Vehicle"" Form (form #VD-147) may be submitted in lieu of a copy of the lease agreement and dealer worksheet. Original Acquisition Cost - Lease End Value = Purchase Price. The Purchase Price is the amount that will be taxed.

. No, not from Vermont. Several states, including Florida, will collect taxes equal to the rate of your home state. In this example, the Vermont tax is 6%, so they will charge you 6% tax. That tax money is not transferred to Vermont. The only way to get any portion of it refunded to you is to contact the state that collected the tax. The documentation fee, which represents a charge for the preparation and handling of sale documents regardless of whether or not the vehicle is financed, should be included in the overall purchase price of the vehicle and is therefore subject to the Purchase and Use Tax.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**
Hotel/Motel Tax Rate Increase
In the October 1, 2019 CBJ Municipal Election, voters approved an increase to the
CBJ Hotel/Motel tax, raising the tax rate from 7% to 9%. This increase will become
effective January 1, 2020.
The increased Hotel/Motel tax of 9% must be collected in addition to the CBJ
Sales Tax of 5% for a total tax collected of 14%. Each guest is responsible for
paying both taxes. The taxes are due at the time of collection of the rent.
Hotel/motel operators, (including small scale, short-term vacation rental
operators) are responsible for the collection of both the 9% Hotel/Motel tax and
the 5% CBJ Sales Tax.
If you are an operator that advertises through hosting platforms such as Airbnb
and VRBO, be advised that both platforms now allow hosts to set the appropriate
tax rates to charge and collect the total tax of 14% at the time of booking. The
platforms will then forward the collected taxes to the host for payment to CBJ.
This is a relatively new feature for Airbnb. Contact the Airbnb Help Center or CBJ
Sales Tax Office for instructions and/or assistance in setting up this tool.
If there are any questions regarding the increased Hotel/Motel Tax rate, please
contact the CBJ Sales Tax Office at the above email address or phone number for
more details.

Clinton Singletary

Maximum Tax (Refund Cap)
The maximum tax is the amount of tax that may apply to a single transaction. If the purchaser pays more than the
maximum tax amount on a purchase, the purchaser may apply to the Tax Commissioner for a refund of any tax paid
in excess of the maximum tax. Retailers may voluntarily collect up to the maximum tax amount as a convenience to
their customers, so the purchasers do not need to apply for a refund. Retailers are not required to calculate
maximum tax and may continue to collect tax without regard to the maximum tax. Retailers should be consistent in
the method they choose to calculate local taxes.
